# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

The goal of this assignment was to create a daily work scheduler that is interactive and dynamic throughout the day.
Specifically, we needed dynamically updated HTML and CSS that featured:

* Text that is stored locally and able to be procured at any time
* Color-coded sections that reflect the current time of day relative to the allocated time slots
* An interactable save button, that works only when the button is pressed

We were provided an HTML and CSS file, and although they required some tweaking, most of the time and effort and spent on creating a Javascript file from scratch.
The starter code uses Moment.js, and as I am currently just beginning to touch on jQuery and libraries in general, I thought it was best to stick to what was given, even though the rubic mentioned the ability to use other libraries.
